note: This is my web technology assignment, I recreated apple's website using my own learnings and i wasnt able to integrate a login and sign up page because it would impact the websites design and make it look bad.






Report:
I faced various challenges while creating this site, and some of them took a lot of time to overcome. Additionally, I had to search extensively for high-quality pictures used on the website, which made it incredibly time-consuming. I also had to use Photoshop to edit out a few icons, and I used AI to upscale the images to higher resolutions. Unfortunately, I didn't get enough time to fully finish the site, but I did learn a lot from this experience. I consulted various sources, read posts, used the inspect element option in my browser, and sought guidance from ChatGPT wherever necessary.
